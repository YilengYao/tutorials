    "# Motivation for Ansible\n",
    "## Automating Device Management\n",
    "- It all started with servers in the server room and administrator managing it\n",
    "- The server room become a datacenter\n",
    "- And after cloud came Internet of Things\n",
    "- How are you going to manage that is a consistent way?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ansible vs. Shell Scripts\n",
    "- Modern day datacenters need automation\n",
    "- Shell scripting is feasible in small environments only\n",
    "- - Can you install 3 servers as a webserver with a database using shell scripts?\n",
    "- - How easy is it to put different parameters in shell scripts?\n",
    "- - What can you do with a shellscript if and administrator makes an error and removes configuration?\n",
    "- - How easy is it to use a shell script deploying a desired state?\n",
    "- - What can you od with shell scripts across different Linux Distributions?\n",
    "- The answer lies in Configuration Management\n",
    "- In Configuration Management, you'll define a desired state. If current state changes, you'll just re-apply the desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ansible vs. Puppet and Others\n",
    "- Ansible is just one of the configuration managemnet solutions\n",
    "- Other solutions are Puppet, Chef, Salt, CFEngine and more\n",
    "- Is Ansible really better than the others?\n",
    "- It is definitely easier than many others\n",
    "- And it doesn't need an agent on manged servers, but uses SSH\n",
    "- Ansible is modular which makes it fexible\n",
    "- And the modules by defult written in Python\n",
    "- Ober 1000 modules are already available and administrators who know Pyothon can develop their own Ansible modules\n",
    " \n",
    "## Beyond just Linux\n",
    "- Using Ansible allows you to manage anything\n",
    "- The origins were in managing Linux through SSH\n",
    "- Using different plugins, many other assets can be managed\n",
    "- Different assets can be managed by direct API access\n",
    "- In the end that helps managing the enterprise through Ansible\n",
    "- Modules are written for very differetn assets, to speak the language of the specific managed devices"
