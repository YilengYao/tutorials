    "- JUnit 5 is released in September of 2017\n",
    "- - Rapidly gaining popularity\n",
    "- JUnit 5 will be the primary focus here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TestNG\n",
    "- Created by Cedric Beust in 2004 as an alternative to JUit\n",
    "- Cedric wished to address deficiencies in JUnit\n",
    "- Functionality of TestNG and JUnit have evolved to be very close.\n",
    "- Still popular, but musch smaller base\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spock \n",
    "- Testing Framework in Groovy for testing Java\n",

    "## CI Continuous Intergration\n",
    "Continuous Integration (CI): is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. ThoughWorks\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Continuous Integration doesn't get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove.\" - Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks\n",
    "\n",
    "### CI Practices\n",
    "CI Practices per Martin Fowler:\n",
    "- Maintain a Single Source Repository\n",
    "- Automate Build\n",
    "- Make your build self-testing\n",
    "- Every commit should Build on Integration Server\n",
    "- Fix broken builds immediately\n",
    "- Keep the build fast\n",
    "- Test a Clone of the production environment\n",
    "- Make it Easy for anyone to get the latest execuable version\n",
    "- Everyopne can see what is happending.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common CI Build Servers\n",
    "Self-Hosted:\n",
    "- Jenkins, Bamboo, TeamCity, Hudson\n",
    "- - Fun-Fact: Jenkins forked from Hudson in 2010 due to a legal conflict with Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Based:\n",
    "- CircleCI, TravisCI, Codeship, GitLab CI, AWS CodeBuild\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CD - Continuous Deployment\n",
    "- Continuous Deployment will automate deploy build artifiacts after all CI tests have run\n",
    "- Should Happend with every Commit\n",
    "- Completely Automated\n",
    "- May include a Staging Area from which Additional Automated Tests are run\n",
    "- Easily confused with Continuous Delivery\n",
    "- Eg: AWS CodePipeline\n",
    "- Process to Automatically Deliver code changes directly to the Production Environment\n",
    "- Involves a High Degree of Automation in Testing and Depl9oyment\n",
    "- Must have a *VERY\"* Mature Process\n",
    "- Can be Difficult in some industries due to regulatory requirements\n",
    "- This area is evolving\n",
    "- - Few Hard \"Rules\" - No Standardd Way\n",
    "- - \"Best Practices\" are maturing, and still a lot of lively debate!"
