    "- Kubernetes, also referred to as K8s, is Greek and means helmsman or pilot\n",
    "- - So it's the captain of the ship with all the dcontainers\n",
    "- Kubernetes is an extensive open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services\n",
    "- It comes from Google Borgn a system that Google has been useing since 2002 to run its applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Else is Kubernetes?\n",
    "- It's open-source software for automating deployment, scaling, and orchestration of containerized applications\n",
    "- - Instead of running containers with the **docker** command, you'll use the **kubernetes** command to run them\n",
    "- It is about running multiple connected containers, organized in Pods, or deployment,s runnimg on different hosts, where community of service is guaranteed\n",
    "- It has become the de factor standard for orchestration of containers\n",
    "- With a new release every 3 months, it is rapidly evolving\n",

    "# Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Container?\n",
    "- A container is a solution that bundles an application and all of its dependencies in a box\n",
    "- - Kernel is not included\n",
    "- This box can run on virtually any platform, as long as that platform runs a container engine\n",
    "- Containers are based on an image, from the idmage you can spin multiple containers\n",
    "- - When the container is crete it runs a process on the host kernel. The host kernel isolates resources belonging to each container\n",
    "- - For resource isolation, namespaces are used\n",
    "- - To dedicate resources, cgroups are used\n",
    "\n",
    "## Container Filesystems\n",
    "- Container images consist of different layers\n",
    "- These layers are joined in the union filesystem\n",
    "- By overlaying these layers, a new virtual filesystem is created\n",
    "- The layers are joined in images, and by default are read-only\n",
    "- When a container is started, the ephemeral read-write layer is added\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Containers are Successful\n",
    "- Very fast deployment\n",
    "- Flexible, as they run anywhere\n",
    "- Easy to scale up and down\n",
    "- Very resource-efficient\n",
    "- Little footprint\n",
    "- Portable"
