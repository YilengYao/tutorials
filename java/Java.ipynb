    "- Abstract classes are similar to Interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contian a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.\n",

    "- However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete class is a class that has an implementation for all of its methods. They cannot have any unimplemented methods. It can also extend an abstract class or implement an interface as long as it implements all their methods. It is a complete class and can be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use an Abstract class when ...\n",
    "- You want to share code amound several closely related classes (Animal - with fields name, age...)\n",
    "- You expect classes that extend your abstract class to have many common methods or fields or require access modifiers other than public (protected, private).\n",
    "- You wnat to declare non static or non final fields Ufor example name, age), this enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of an object (getName, setName).\n",
    "- When you have a requirement for your base class to provide a default implementation of certain methods but other methods should be open to being overriden by child classes.\n",
    "- Summary: The purpose of an Abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface\n",
    "- An interface is jsut the declaration of methods of an Class, it's not the implementation.\n",
    "- In an interface, we define what kind of operation an object can perform. These operations are defined by the classes that implement the Interface.\n",
    "- Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enfoced at build time by the compiler.\n",
    "- You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. All mentods in interfaces are automatically public and abstract. \n",
    "- An interface can extend another interface.\n",
    "- Interfaces are more flexible and can dea with a lot more stress on the design of your program than the implementation.\n",
    "- By introducing interfaces into your program, you are really intruducing points of variation at which you can plug in different implemnatations for tha interface. An Interfaces primary purpose is abstraction, decoupling the \"what\" from the \"how\".\n",
    "- NOTE: Since Java 8 interfactes can contain default methods. In other words method with implementation. The keyward default is used (mostly for backwards compatibility_, and static methods as well before Java 8 that was not possible.\n",

    "- You want to separate different behaviour.\n",

    "# Immutable Objects\n",
    "An object is considered *immutable* if its state cannot change ofter it is constructed. Maximum reliance on immutable objects is widely accepted as a sound strategy for creating simple, reliable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects are (threadsafe) which is particularly useful in concurrent applications. Since they cannot change state, they cannot be corrupted by thread interface or obserbed in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers are often reluctant to employ immutable objects, because they worry about the cost of creating a new object as oppose to updating an object in place. The impact of object creation is often overestimated, and can be offset by some of the efficiencies associated with immutable objects. These include decrease overhead due to decrease overhead due to garbage collection, and the elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy for Defining Immutable Objects\n",
    "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/imstrat.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The following rules define a simple strategy for creating immutable objecst, Not all classes documented as\"immutable\" following these rules. This does not necessarily mean the creator of these classes were sloppy -- they may have good reason for believing that instances of their classes never change after construction. However, such strategies require sophisticated analysis and are not for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't provide \"setter\" methods -- methods modify fields of object referred by fields.\n",
    "1. Make all fields *final* and *private*.\n",
    "1. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to decalre the class as *final*. A more sophisticated approach is to makde the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.\n",
    "1. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow these objects to be changed:\n",
    " - Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.\n",
    " - Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objecst when necessary to aboid returning the orginals to your methods.\n",
    " \n",
    "Applying this strategy to SynchronizedRGB results in the following steps:\n",
    "1. There are two setter methods in this class. The first one, set, arbitrarily transforms the object, and has no place in an immutable version of the class. The second one, *invert*, can be adapted by having it create a new object instead of modifying the existing one.\n",
    "2. All fields are already private; they are further qualified as *final*.\n",
    "3. The class itself is declared *final*.\n",
    "4. Only one field refers to an object, and that object is itself immutable. Therefore, no safegards against changing the state of \"contained\" mutable objects are necessary.\n",
