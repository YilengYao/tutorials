    "# Interface vs Abstract Class\n",
    "## Abstract Class\n",
    "- Abstract classes are similar to Interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contian a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.\n",
    "- However, with Abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final and define public, protected and private concrete methods.\n",
    "- When an Abstract class can extend only one parent class but it can implement multiple interfaces.\n",
    "- When an Abstract class is sublassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.\n",
    "- However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete class is a class that has an implementation for all of its methods. They cannot have any unimplemented methods. It can also extend an abstract class or implement an interface as long as it implements all their methods. It is a complete class and can be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use an Abstract class when ...\n",
    "- You want to share code amound several closely related classes (Animal - with fields name, age...)\n",
    "- You expect classes that extend your abstract class to have many common methods or fields or require access modifiers other than public (protected, private).\n",
    "- You wnat to declare non static or non final fields Ufor example name, age), this enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of an object (getName, setName).\n",
    "- When you have a requirement for your base class to provide a default implementation of certain methods but other methods should be open to being overriden by child classes.\n",
    "- Summary: The purpose of an Abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface\n",
    "- An interface is jsut the declaration of methods of an Class, it's not the implementation.\n",
    "- In an interface, we define what kind of operation an object can perform. These operations are defined by the classes that implement the Interface.\n",
    "- Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enfoced at build time by the compiler.\n",
    "- You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. All mentods in interfaces are automatically public and abstract. \n",
    "- An interface can extend another interface.\n",
    "- Interfaces are more flexible and can dea with a lot more stress on the design of your program than the implementation.\n",
    "- By introducing interfaces into your program, you are really intruducing points of variation at which you can plug in different implemnatations for tha interface. An Interfaces primary purpose is abstraction, decoupling the \"what\" from the \"how\".\n",
    "- NOTE: Since Java 8 interfactes can contain default methods. In other words method with implementation. The keyward default is used (mostly for backwards compatibility_, and static methods as well before Java 8 that was not possible.\n",
    "- NOTE: Since Java 9 an Interface can also contain private methods (commonly used when 2 default methods in an Interface share common code).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use an Interface when...\n",
    "- You expect ath unrelated classes will implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implmented by many unrelated classes.\n",
    "- You want to specify the behaviour of a particular data type, but you are not concerned about who implements its behaviour.\n",
    "- You want to separate different behaviour.\n",
    "- The Collections Api is an excellent example, we have the List interface and implementations ArrayList and LinkedList \n",
    "- The JDBC API is another excellent example. It exist of almost only interfaces. The concrete implementations are provided as \"JDBC drivers\". This enables you to write all the JDBC conde independent of the database (DB) vendor. You will learn more aobut JDBC later in the course."
