    "- BIOS and UEFI are interfaces offered on a PC platform to access disks\n",
    "- UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)/EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) were introduced to replace BIOS that has been introduced in 1981 and not seen major changes since.\n",
    "- Both BIOS and UEFI were developed to provide a platform that sits between hardware/firmware and operating system\n",
    "- Using UEFI offers several advantages, which is why it is becoming the standard interface on modern PCs\n",
    "- The most significant advantage is its ability to boot from large disks when a GUID (Global Unique Identifier) Partition Table (GPT) is used\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the boot loader loads the kernel\n",
    "- The boot loader needs to find the kernel and start it with the appropritate parameters\n",
    "- The challenge is that the boot loader needs to read the kernel somethwere from disk, even if it doesn't have any kernel drivers yet\n",
    "- For thsi early access, disk firmware provides Linear Block Access (LBA_, which provides a slow but uniform method to access disks\n",
    "- Most boot loaders have minimal filesystem knowledge, allowing them to read the kernel file from disk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booting from UEFI or BIOS disks\n",
    "- On a BIOS system, the Master Boot Record (MBR) is read from disk and the stage 1 boot loader is activated\n",
    "- - The stage 1 boot loader is only 446 bytes and its task is to load the larger 2 boot loader that resides in the first MB of the disk\n",
    "- On an UEFI system, a GPT partition table is always used; and MBR is maintained for backward compatibility\n",
    "- The GPT partition table contains an EFI System Partition (ESP) which contains a directory with the name efi\n",
    "- In this directory, each boot loader has its own identifier and correspoonding sub directory (/efi/microsoft. /efi/grib)\n",

    "- The challenge in these environments is that many processes need to establish one-on-one relations and that is not very efficient\n",
    "- D-Bus provides a software bus abstraction that creates one virtual channel that can be used for communications between a group of processes\n",
    "- Using a D-Bus ensures that all processes can commect directly to one another\n",
    "- Typically, Linux implements multiple busses: a single system bus that is available to all users and processes and a session bus for each user login session\n",
